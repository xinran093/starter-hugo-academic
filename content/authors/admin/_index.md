Welcome! My name is Xinran Zhu ( *æœ±æ¬£ç„¶* in Chinese). I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Learning Sciences and Technologies at University of Pennsylvania. I am a learning **designer** and **researcher** who develop educational innovations to understand and support learning and collaboration. 

Broadly, my interests lie at the intersection of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) and Learning Analytics (or "Collaborative Learning Analytics"). My research agenda is centered around this question: **How do human collaborate and learn with technologies?**

Tï»¿his question has led my current work along two paths:

1ï»¿. I design, prototype, and evaluate a [technology innovation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIn5NR-ZrOJJwmNe9qB_FvDjshmg4-vIWX36PpxuA0w/edit) to support studentsâ€™ knowledge synthesis processes in collaborative learning. (ðŸŒ¼ Design update: need a cool name for it!!)

2ï»¿. I develop analytical frameworks to model socio-cognitive engagement in collaborative learning by combining network sciences and Natural Language Processing techniques.

I love ðŸš— roadtrips, ðŸ“· photography, and  ðŸŽˆadventures.
